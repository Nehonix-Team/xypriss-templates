# {{SERVER_NAME}}


Welcome to your new **XyPriss** project. This project has been initialized using the high-performance XHSC engine and is designed with a **Zero-Trust** security model in mind.

## Overview

{{DESCRIPTION}}


## Project Architecture

The project is organized into modular layers to ensure strict separation of concerns:

- **Core Entry Point**: The main server instance (typically `src/server.ts`) orchestrates subsystems and boot cycles.
- **Configuration Store**: Managed via the **Environment Security Shield**, ensuring no secrets leak globally.
- **Traffic Management**: Uses the native Radix-Trie router for efficient request distribution.
- **Business Logic**: Isolated service layers for simplified maintenance and testing.
- **Server Definitions**: (XMS Mode) Multiple isolated server instances (e.g., API, Auth, Admin) running on distinct ports.
